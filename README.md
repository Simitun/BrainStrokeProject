# BrainStrokeProject
Acknowledgment
Firstly, I would like to say thanks to my parents, my brothers, my sisters, my AI teacher(Sa Phyo Thu Htet), my fundamental Python teacher(Tr Htet Htet Mon), and my team partner Ma Phuu Pwint Thinzar Kyaing. This is my first project concerned with the IT field. Therefore, I had many difficult and many experiments doing this project. I frankly confess that this project should not use in practical health centers. Because this is not safe and precise now. I will try to modify this project to be the best. I would like to create this project to be helpful and efficient for people next time.

Abstract
A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a blood clot or bursts. This disease is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the fifth of death women. The people who are suffering the brain stroke disease are about 15 million all over the world. Among them, 5.5 million people died from this disease. Another 5 million people were suffering from being permanently disabled in their leftover lives. The main cause occurring this disease is because of increased blood pressure suddently. The ages of 55 and 75 people can cause more than other ages. The worst case is this disease can cause even new moms. As discovered by scientists and physicians, pregnant women put at higher risk for stroke during this time. This disease occurs more in very hot countries than in others. We made this project to reduce the number of suffering from this disease. We will hope that this project is very useful and convenient for the people.

Goal of project
Our goals doing this project are:
to affect the people, 
to support the medical center in another way,
to improve the AI technology

Difficulties
When we made this project, we faced the data inequivalent problem. The ratio of stroke and no stroke are clearly different from this dataset. We do not solve this problem yet because we are AI, fundamental students. But we will try to solve this problem next time. Therefore, some scores are not good and the predicted score is not true sometimes.
